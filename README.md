Basic slingshot in SpriteKit (Xcode 7)

I wrote this tiny code just to play around with the basic of SpriteKit in Swift.
What the code does is having a ball (weaponNode) that is slung back and project to touch a certain object (enemyNode).
The enemyNode will disappear upon contact.

The core algorithm is in **Gamescene.swift**

Hope it could be of help those who just pick up SpriteKit! :)

This is a testing stage. warning: nothing will be harmed. So keep your shit together.
